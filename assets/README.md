# Horiseon Refactor

## Description

I was provided starter code to be revised and refactored for best practices. The starter code is the home page of the Horiseon website. With a non working link and many non descriptive elements, with multiple class selectors or blocks doing the same thing.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## In the End

After completing the challenge, the website should appear the same. Links will work as expected and the HTML and CSS file should be clean and easily understood. To view the completed site click
